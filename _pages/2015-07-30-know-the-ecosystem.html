<h2><strong>It pays to know the ecosystem</strong></h2>
<p>You can spend a lot of time figuring out which graph database approach to take. We can help you navigate the variety of tools and techniques available for different purposes, and for the programming languages your team uses. We understand the difference between an online transaction processing (OLTP) system and a tool for offline data analysis—and the different graph techniques they require.</p>
<p>At XN Logic, we are enmeshed in the&nbsp;<a href="http://www.meetup.com/GraphTO">graph community</a>&nbsp;and familiar with the range of products on offer. Our open-source query language,&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/pangloss/pacer">Pacer</a>, enables easy migration to your graph database of choice. With Pacer’s high-performance queries you can:</p>
<ul>
<li>Interact with a range of databases</li>
<li>Declare your business domains and data structures</li>
<li>Generate an entire application</li>
</ul>
<p>Expressive and simple to understand, Pacer facilitates getting info in and out, and building applications that use that information.</p>
