<h1>Leverage Years Of Software Development</h1>
<p>Simple modelling of dozens of similar but distinct types of data? Check!</p>
<p>Sophisticated pre-defined queries? Of course!</p>
<p>Flexible user-defined queries? Naturally.</p>
<p>Long-running distributed tasks launched, managed and tracked? Oh yeah! &nbsp;</p>

And despite using a variety of the most popular and innovative tools, they really did only a very small part of the job - the easiest part - before leaving me on my own to solve the most challenging aspects of these same problems on my own. Despite being extremely commonplace, there are no simple solutions to these problems.</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>An API for a real-world data model.</strong></p>
<p>APIs are usually flat, and that's a huge limitation because the world is round. Imagine a simple project management system. Let's look at a PM. Every API will give you that. Let's see all of the projects she is managing. Okay, now we're&nbsp;</p>
