<h1><span><strong>From graph database to enterprise application</strong></span></h1>
<p>Iterating quickly might mean the difference between meeting your market window and permanently missing an opportunity. You might be grappling with large amounts of data that make development unwieldy. You have the idea that you can structure your data in a graph, but how?</p>
<ul dir="ltr">
<li>How do you structure and query graph databases so your info is more available, and useful? The right approach can lead to serendipity, give you a more accurate sense of the size of your development task, and generate new ideas.</li>
<li>How do you get your data into a graph database? If you’re starting from an existing database this can be a complex and lengthy process.</li>
<li>How do you make graph data useful, or turn it into an application?</li>
</ul>
<p>Using XN Logic’s platform helps you get business logic into your data, structure it, and develop functioning applications—quickly.</p>
<h2>Time to market depends on the right expertise</h2>
<p>Not having the right expertise on hand when you need it can cause you to miss your market window. Even well-managed development projects can fail. You have the data to create applications. The question is: How to use it? You might understand that graph databases offer tremendous potential but how can this technology work for you?</p>
<p>As the <a href="/about-us">creators</a> of Pacer, the first truly expressive graph traversal library written in any existing programming language, XN Logic applies a deep understanding of graph-related problems in low-level graph traversal to application architecture. You can expect not only faster development approaches and graph database queries from us but also dispassionate advice on the best solutions to your technical problems. We give you the end-to-end expertise you need for success. By presenting information how you want to see it, we can get you up and running—in weeks as opposed to months—with a full-featured application, that includes security, a user interface, and easy integration into your product suite.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
<h2>It pays to know the ecosystem</h2>
<p>You can spend a lot of time figuring out which graph database approach to take. We can help you navigate the variety of tools and techniques available for different purposes, and for the programming languages your team uses. We understand the difference between an online transaction processing (OLTP) system and a tool for offline data analysis—and the different graph techniques they require.</p>
<p>At XN Logic we’re enmeshed in the <a href="http://www.meetup.com/GraphTO">graph community</a>&nbsp;and familiar with the range of products on offer. Our open-source query language, <a href="https://github.com/pangloss/pacer">Pacer</a>, enables easy to migration to our graph database of choice, Neo4j. With Pacer’s high-performance queries you can:</p>
<ul>
<li>Interact with a range of databases</li>
<li>Declare your business domains and data structures</li>
<li>Generate an entire application</li>
</ul>
<p>Expressive and simple to understand, Pacer facilitates getting info in and out, and building applications that use that information.</p>

<h2>Profiting from our capabilities</h2>
<p>You can complete projects more efficiently if you not only know the right tools but also how to use them. While building the XN Logic framework, we've worked with Neo4j, Orient, and Dex graph databases and understand their unique pros and cons. We also understand where a key-value store, a document store, or a relational database might be a better fit for your requirements. We know how to tie your graph database to an alternate type of data store to achieve your project’s goals. We achieve all of this cleanly with our proven toolset.</p>
<ul>
<li>Major challenges in creating custom APIs include identifying and designing:</li>
<li>Simple user tools</li>
<li>Query shortcuts that facilitate ad-hoc queries</li>
<li>Freedom from the limitation of having to program queries</li>
<li>Easier integration with your other applications</li>
</ul>

<p>Our two-step business process:</p>
<ol>
<li>Declare your info.</li>
<li>Define your business model.</li>
</ol>
<p>
  This dramatically shrinks the time spent doing boilerplate API and UI tasks.</p>

<h3 style="margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px;">Your data is already a graph</h3>
<p>A graph is the perfect way to model your data. When you draw out a concrete example of your data for someone, what you draw is a graph. It is the natural way you express your data. When we work with you to model your data, most of the effort can be devoted to simply describing it. Ask us how we can help you translate your description directly to a graph data model. From there it’s a small step to a functioning application that you can iterate, rapidly.</p>
<h3>Extensible API</h3>
<p>Typically APIs are very static, and they often require re-programming. The XN Logic API is extensible, allowing you to build out URLs in any valid way because of its ability to retain context. So, with any standard requests already in the system, this means you can just keep adding requests in an existing context. As a result, you save time building on the existing things that teams typically spend time on, freeing you up to do more sophisticated tasks that add the most value to your business.</p>
<p>Check out this example of our API in action. Note how it accomplishes in a few lines of declaration something that would normally require many more lines of code and exponentially more effort.</p>
<h3>Time Machine</h3>
<p>XN Logic’s framework includes the HistoryGraph which lets you run ad-hoc queries on your system in real-time to generate a comprehensive analysis of that system at any point of its existence. Usually that kind of information is static—dumped to a record—and requires pre-processing, plus the involvement of other people. The HistoryGraph eliminates that and is non-resource-intensive.</p>
