<h1>We are 100% focussed on graph database technology.</h1>
<p>The expressiveness of the graph combined with the power of our platform is the optimum foundation for serious enterprise software.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Graph DB expertise</strong></p>
<p>As the creators of Pacer, the first truly expressive graph traversal library written in any existing programming language, we bring a deep understanding of graph related problems from low-level graph traversal to application architecture. We give our clients the end-to-end expertise they need to succeed.</p>
<p><strong>What we offer</strong></p>
<p>Using our platform, we can rapidly move your project from idea to execution. We work with you to transfer knowledge and develop in-house skills on the cutting edge technologies we use.</p>
<p>You'll end up with an easy to understand and maintain project that provides the tools you need to take your project to the next level.</p>
<p><strong>We know the ecosystem</strong></p>
<p>We can help you navigate the variety of tools and techniques that are available for different needs and for the languages your team has experience with. We understand the difference between an OLTP system and a tool for offline data analysis and the graph techniques they require.</p>
<p><strong>We know which tool to use</strong></p>
<p>While building the xnlogic stack, we've worked with Neo4j, Orient and Dex graph databases and understand their unique pros and cons. In addition we understand where a KV store, a document store or a relational database may be a better fit. We know how to tie your graph database to an alternate type of data store to achieve your project's goals. All of this is cleanly achieved with our existing toolset.</p>
<p><strong>The technologies that make xnlogic awesome</strong></p>
