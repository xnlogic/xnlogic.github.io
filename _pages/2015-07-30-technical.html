<p><font color="#111111"><b>Compose a data model</b></font></p>
<p>Once we've described what our data is made of it's very easy to pull the pieces back together to describe all of the trickiest pieces of tho most sophisticated domains. Because we already have our pieces defined, putting them together is just a simple declaration for us though.</p>
<p><strong>Instant API</strong></p>
<p>As soon as you've got the first piece of your data model described, you can launch the API server! Each property, relationship, query and action that you have defined is available in a clear and easy to use structure. The API is powerful, too, able to follow queries and relationships deep into the graph in a single request.</p>
<p><strong>Describe the simplest pieces of data</strong></p>
<p>The most surprising thing about the most sophisticated data structures is how simple they can be when broken down to their most basic components. That's where we start when building a data model. It leads to surprising power.</p>
<p><strong>Distributed actions</strong></p>
<p>Real world data doesn't just sit idle. We let you attach custom actions and even wire your existing services to your data. Once you've found the data you are looking for, kick off an action using that same query or record. We'll give you back what you need to keep track of the job's progress and see its results.</p>
<p><strong>Role-based security</strong></p>
<p>Remember those basic components we broke the data model into? They are our starting point for a powerful and flexible security system. Define roles with specific Create / Read / Update / Delete / Execute access to the specific parts of your data model, regardless of how or how many different ways you've composed those same parts. Your security model will be solid and easy to understand.</p>
<p><strong>Metadata for everything</strong></p>
<p>It's extremely easy to work with our API because it's always full of information about where you are and where you've come from. If you want to know what's available to you at a given API endpoint, simply add /metadata to the end of the URL and you'll be given neatly structured information on the data it will return as well as the relationships, queries and actions available. It makes the API really easy to use and build tools on.</p>
<p><strong>Queries via the API</strong></p>

<p>The xnlogic platform is built on our powerful open source graph traversal library, Pacer. Pacer builds on the powerful and fast Pipes Java library by Tinkerpop (which our co-founder Darrick is a member of).</p>
