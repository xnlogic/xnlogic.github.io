### FROM GRAPH DATABASE TO ENTERPRISE APPLICATION

Iterating quickly might mean the difference between meeting your market window and permanently missing an opportunity. You might be grappling with large amounts of data that make development unwieldy. You have the idea that you can structure your data in a graph, but how?

Using the [XN Framework](/xn-framework) helps you get business logic into your data, structure it, and develop functioning applications—quickly.

<br /><br />

### THE TIME TO MARKET DEPENDS ON THE RIGHT EXPERTISE
Not having the right expertise on hand when you need it can cause you to miss your market window. 

Even well-managed development projects can fail. You have the data to create applications. The question is: How to use it? You might understand that graph databases offer tremendous potential but how can this technology work for you?

As the creators of [Pacer](https://github.com/pangloss/pacer), the first truly expressive graph traversal library written in any existing programming language, XN Logic applies a deep understanding of graph-related problems in low-level graph traversal to application architecture. 

You can expect not only faster development approaches and graph database queries from us but also dispassionate advice on the best solutions to your technical problems. We give you the end-to-end expertise you need for success. 

By presenting information how you want to see it, we can get you up and running—in weeks as opposed to months—with a full-featured application, that includes security, a user interface, and easy integration into your product suite.

### IT PAYS TO KNOW THE ECOSYSTEM
You can spend a lot of time figuring out which graph database approach to take. 

We can help you navigate the variety of tools and techniques available for different purposes, and for the programming languages your team uses. We understand the difference between an online transaction processing (OLTP) system and a tool for offline data analysis—and the different graph techniques they require.

At XN Logic, we are enmeshed in the graph community and familiar with the range of products on offer. Our open-source query language, [Pacer](https://github.com/pangloss/pacer), enables easy migration to your graph database of choice. 

With Pacer’s high-performance queries you can:

* -> Interact with a range of databases
* -> Declare your business domains and data structures
* -> Generate an entire application

Expressive and simple to understand, Pacer facilitates getting info in and out, and building applications that use that information.
